How good are you at high-level css animation? Can you create an ethereal background that is vaporous but with very slight movement? We're going for ghostly and creepy, and I am definitely not opposed to bringing in libraries in order to achieve a "Wow" factor result.

For an ethereal, ghostly background, let's use either GSAP, Three.js, or for some really impressive effects. Here's what I'm thinking:
- Three.js with a custom shader for ethereal fog/mist
- We could create a subtle, floating mist that responds to mouse movement
- Add some particle effects that look like floating embers or ghostly wisps
