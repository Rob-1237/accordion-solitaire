Firebase Sanity Checklist
We'll cover Authentication and Database (Firestore), as those are your primary touchpoints for user accounts and game state.

A. Firebase Authentication Checklist
Login/Signup Flow (Client-Side Experience):

User Creation: Can new users successfully sign up with email/password (or any other methods you've enabled like Google, etc.)?
Login: Can existing users log in successfully?
Logout: Does the logout functionality work as expected, clearing the user's session and redirecting them appropriately?
Password Reset: (If implemented) Does the password reset flow work (sending email, allowing reset)?
Error Handling: Are user-friendly error messages displayed for common issues (e.g., wrong password, email already in use, network errors)?
Persistence: If you're using firebase.auth().setPersistence(firebase.auth.Auth.Persistence.LOCAL), does the user stay logged in across browser sessions?
Firebase Console Verification (Back-End Health):

Users List: Go to your Firebase project in the console, navigate to "Authentication," and then "Users." Do you see new user accounts appearing as expected after sign-up?
Sign-in Methods: Under "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method," confirm that the methods you intend to use (e.g., Email/Password) are enabled.
Usage Monitoring: Briefly check the "Usage and Billing" section for Authentication to ensure usage patterns look normal and you're not approaching any unexpected limits.
Auth State Listener: Is your React app listening for onAuthStateChanged to correctly update the UI when a user logs in/out or their auth state changes? (This is crucial for the UI to reflect login status).
B. Firebase Database (Firestore) Checklist
Since you're saving game state, Firestore security rules are paramount.

Data Structure (in Firestore):

Browse Data: Go to your Firebase project in the console, navigate to "Firestore Database," and "Data."
User Data: Do you see a collection (e.g., users or games) where game states are stored? Is each user's game state clearly associated with their uid (User ID)? For example, a common pattern is users/{userId}/games/{gameId} or games/{gameId} with a userId field.
Game State Fields: Within a game document, are all the necessary fields for a game state present (e.g., board, score, moves, lastUpdated, userId)?
Updates: When you make a move in the game, do you see the corresponding game document in Firestore update in real-time?
Security Rules (Critical!):

"Rules" Tab: Navigate to "Firestore Database" -> "Rules."
Default State: Ensure your rules are not set to allow read, write: true; (or similar for Realtime Database). This would make your database publicly accessible.
User-Specific Access: Do your rules ensure that:
A user can ONLY read their own game data? (e.g., allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;)
A user can ONLY write (create/update/delete) their own game data? (e.g., allow write: if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId; for new data, or request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId; for existing data).
No unauthenticated users can read or write game data? (This is often the default if you're not explicitly allowing public read/write).
Data Validation: (Optional but recommended) Are there any basic validation rules to ensure the board data, for instance, conforms to a expected structure or size? This prevents malformed data from being saved.
Testing Rules: Use the "Rules Playground" in the Firebase console.
Simulate a logged-in user trying to read/write their own data – it should succeed.
Simulate a logged-in user trying to read/write another user's data – it should fail.
Simulate an unauthenticated user trying to read/write any data – it should fail.
C. General Firebase Practices
API Key Restrictions (Google Cloud Console):
While Firebase API keys are generally not secret for client-side use, it's a good practice to restrict them. In the Google Cloud Console (APIs & Services -> Credentials), you can edit your API key and add restrictions to only allow requests from your specific web domain and only to the Firebase APIs you are using (e.g., Identity Toolkit API, Cloud Firestore API). This adds a layer of defense against misuse.
firebase.json (Deployment/Hosting):
Confirm your firebase.json file is correctly configured for hosting your React app (e.g., public directory points to your build output, typically build or dist).
Error Monitoring (Optional):
If you're launching this publicly, consider setting up Firebase Crashlytics or Google Cloud Logging/Monitoring for production issues.
